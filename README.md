## About Los Angeles Open Data <a name="laopendata"></a>
The City of Los Angeles provides city data with the public to increase transparency, accountability and customer service and to empower companies, individuals and non-profit organizations with the ability to harness a vast array of useful information to improve life in our city. The purpose of the data is to help drive innovation and problem solving within the public and private sectors and that Angelenos will use it to more deeply understand and engage with their city. It is encouraged to explore data.lacity.org to conduct research, develop apps or simply to poke around.

## Building and Safety Permit Information <a name="ladbsdata"></a>
The Department of Building and Safety issues permits for the construction, remodeling, and repair of buildings and structures in the City of Los Angeles. Permits are categorized into building permits, electrical permits, and mechanical permits (which include plumbing, HVAC systems, fire sprinklers, elevators, and pressure vessels). Depending on the complexity of a project, a permit may be issued the same day with Express Permit or e-Permit ("No Plan Check" category), or a permit may require that the plans be reviewed ("Plan Check" category) by a Building and Safety Plan Check personnel.
